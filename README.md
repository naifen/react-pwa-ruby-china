# React.js PWA Ruby China

> A React.js PWA using RubyChina's apis, mobile first and desktop responsive UI & UX.

## Motivation

I consider myself as "rubyist" ðŸ˜„, so I browse various ruby sites to learn new stuff on a daily basis including <https://ruby-china.org/>, which is the biggest ruby community in China, with my mac and phone.

The official IOS client is pretty good and I enjoyed it a lot. Recently I switched to an Android device but couldn't find a decent and up-to-date client.

Since the ruby-china maintainers made some great APIs as well, I figured why not roll my own client? It's 2018 now, PWA is a thing, React's became many folks go-to UI framework, so I decided to combine these two together and give it a try.

My goal here is to focus on the mobile UI(I'll go with <https://material-ui.com/>) & UX, the final app can be saved to desktop and work as a native client(which is a PWA suppose to be like). I'll keep the tech stacks minimal and the app should be snappy and reliable.
