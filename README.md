# React.js PWA Ruby China

> A React.js PWA using RubyChina's apis, mobile first and desktop responsive UI & UX.

## Motivation

I consider myself as "rubyist" ðŸ˜„ and I browse various of ruby sites on a daily basis to learn new stuffs. <https://ruby-china.org/> is one of them, which is the biggest ruby community in China.

The official IOS client is pretty good and I enjoyed it a lot. Recently I switched to an Android device but couldn't find a decent and up-to-date client. (the site itself is responsive, it doesn't feel like an app tho)

Since the ruby-china maintainers made some great APIs as well, I figured why not roll my own client? It's 2018 now, PWA is a thing, React's became many folks go-to UI framework, so I decided to combine these two together and give it a try.

My goal here is to focus on the mobile UI (Material Design <https://material-ui.com/> is my choice) & UX similar to IOS version. The final app can be saved to desktop and work just like a native client(which is what a PWA suppose to be like). I'll try not to bloat it with npm packages and keep it snappy, minimal and reliable.
