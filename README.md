# React.js PWA Ruby China

> A mobile first React.js PWA using RubyChina's apis, responsive desktop UI & UX is also included.

## Motivation

As "rubyist"ðŸ˜„, I browse various of ruby sites on a daily basis to learn new stuffs. <https://ruby-china.org/> is one of them, which is the biggest ruby community in China.

The official Ruby China IOS client is awesome and I enjoyed it a lot. Recently I switched to an Android device and couldn't find a decent and up-to-date client. (tho the site itself is responsive, it doesn't feel like an app)

Since the ruby-china maintainers made great APIs, I figured why not roll my own client? It's 2018 now, PWA is a thing, React's became many folks go-to UI framework. So I decided to combine these two and give it a try.

My goal here is to focus on the mobile UI (Material Design <https://material-ui.com/> is my choice) & UX similar to the offcial IOS version. The app can be saved to desktop and work just like a native client(which is what a PWA suppose to be like). I'll try not to bloat it with too many npm packages, rather just keep it snappy, minimal and reliable.

## Status

WIP, features listed in the Roadmap will be implemented.

```
# remove the browserslist block for a temp fix

    ">0.2%",
    "not dead",
    "not ie <= 11",

## Known issues

- [ ] Firefox fo Android mix content blocker redirect app to browser. When hit a page contains mixed content, PWA will be switched to the browser. <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/mixed-content-blocker-firefox-android>
- [ ] Drag down and reload topics works fine on Firefox for Android, but Chrome has similar Drag down refresh feature. Two reload indicators will appear when using Chrome for Android(top circle spinner is provided by Android)
